# Mods Unturned

Mods-Unturned is a website created by [LCBradley3k](https://www.youtube.com/user/LCBradley3k) for Unturned community members to upload custom maps, assets, and modifications for the rest of the community to see and use. 


The backend is developed by [Jake0oo0](https://jake0oo0.me) in Ruby on Rails, using Bower and NPM for package and asset management. A full test suite is included, using rspec and factory girl. The site also supports JSON API endpoints, and RSS feeds for various views. Both can be accessed by appending ```.json``` or ```.rss``` to most website URLs. The database is built with MongoID on MongoDB, with caching support from Redis. Various libraries such as ```Kaminari``` and ```bb-ruby``` are also used for quicker development, and better support.

## Installation

A full installation guide can be found in ```./etc/INSTALL.txt``` along with other necessary files in ```./etc/```.
